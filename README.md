## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

#### On this project, I took care of working on a calculator on the server side of things.

From using AJAX, GET, and POST. To using a 3-rd party browser to test my server logic.
Then, for the client side of things I took care of click events and inputs. Making four buttons using data operators-
to allow easy control so all that was needed was the event and then a function to create the data operator.
Using that to call on my buttons and the functions that they did. Those buttons ran a calculation of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Also having two other buttons that would submit those calculations and one to clear the field.
